Concepts\n  2. \n\nUnderstanding source roots and source paths\nWhen ZenML interacts with your pipeline code, it needs to understand how to locate and import your code. This page explains how ZenML determines the source root directory and how to construct source paths for referencing your Python objects.\n## \nSource Root\nThe **source root** is the root directory of all your local code files.\nZenML determines the source root using the following priority:\n  1. **ZenML Repository** : If you're in a child directory of a ZenML repository (initialized with `zenml init`), the repository directory becomes the source root. We recommend always initializing a ZenML repository to make the source root explicit.\n  2. **Execution Context Fallback** : If no ZenML repository exists in your current working directory or parent directories, ZenML uses the parent directory of the Python file you're executing. For example, running `/a/b/run.py` sets the source root to `/a/b`.\n\n\nIf you're running in a notebook or an interactive Python environment, there will be no file that is currently executed and ZenML won't be able to automatically infer the source root. Therefore, you'll need to explicitly define the source root by initializing a ZenML repository in these cases.\n## \nSource Paths\nZenML requires source paths in various configuration contexts. These are Python-style dotted paths that reference objects in your code.\n### \nCommon Use Cases\n**Step Hook Configuration** :\nCopy```\nsuccess_hook_source:<SUCCESS-HOOK-SOURCE>\n```\n\n**Pipeline Deployment via CLI** :\nCopy```\nzenmlpipelinedeploy<PIPELINE-SOURCE>\n```\n\n### \nPath Construction\nImport paths must be **relative to your source root** and follow Python import syntax.\n**Example** : Consider this pipeline in `/a/b/c/run.py`:\nCopy```\nfrom zenml import pipeline\n@pipeline\ndef my_pipeline():\n    ...\n```\n\nThe source path depends on your source root:\n  * Source root `/a/b/c` → `run.my_pipeline`\n  * Source root `/a` → `b.c.run.my_pipeline`\n\n\nNote that the source is not a file path, but instead its elements are separated by dots similar to how you would write import statements in Python.\n## \nContainerized Step Execution\nWhen running pipeline steps in containers, ZenML ensures your source root files are available in the container (either by including them in the image or downloading them at runtime).\nTo execute your step code, ZenML imports the Python module containing the step definition. **All imports of local code files must be relative to the source root** for this to work correctly.\nIf you don't need all files inside your source root for step execution, see the containerization guide for controlling which files are included.\nPreviousYAML ConfigurationNextAdvanced Features\nLast updated 1 month ago\nWas this helpful?\n",
