Deploying ZenML\n  2. \n\n# with your User (interactive)\nConnect to the ZenML server using the ZenML CLI and the web based login.\nYou can authenticate your clients with the ZenML Server using the ZenML CLI and the web‑based login (device flow). This method is ideal for humans working locally and applies to OSS servers and ZenML Pro workspaces.\nCopy```\nzenmlloginhttps://...\n```\n\nThis command starts a browser flow to validate the device you are connecting from. You can choose whether to mark the device as trusted. If you don’t trust the device, a 24‑hour token is issued; if you do, a 30‑day token is issued.\nManaging authorized devices for ZenML Pro workspaces is not yet supported in the dashboard. CLI device management is available.\nTo see all devices you've permitted, use the following command:\nCopy```\nzenmlauthorized-devicelist\n```\n\nAdditionally, the following command allows you to more precisely inspect one of these devices:\nCopy```\nzenmlauthorized-devicedescribe<DEVICE_ID>\n```\n\nFor increased security, you can invalidate a token using the `zenml authorized-device lock` command followed by the device ID.\nCopy```\nzenml authorized-device lock <DEVICE_ID>  \n```\n\nTo keep things simple, we can summarize the steps:\n  1. Use the `zenml login <URL>` command to start a device flow and connect to a zenml server.\n  2. Choose whether to trust the device when prompted.\n  3. Check permitted devices with `zenml authorized-device list`.\n  4. Invalidate a token with `zenml authorized-device lock ...`.\n\n\n### \nImportant notice\nUsing the ZenML CLI is a secure and comfortable way to interact with your ZenML servers. It's important to always ensure that only trusted devices are used to maintain security and privacy.\nCalling the ZenML Pro management API (`cloudapi.zenml.io`)? Interactive CLI login does not apply there. Use a ZenML Pro Personal Access Token or a ZenML Pro Service Account and API key instead. See ZenML Pro API Getting Started.\nDon't forget to manage your device trust levels regularly for optimal security. Should you feel a device trust needs to be revoked, lock the device immediately. Every token issued is a potential gateway to access your data, secrets and infrastructure.\nPreviousConnectNextwith your User (programmatic)\nLast updated 22 days ago\nWas this helpful?\n",
    "summary": "## TL;DR Summary\n\n### Deploying ZenML\n\n#### User Authentication\n- **Interactive Login**: Connect to ZenML server using CLI and web-based login (device flow).\n- **Token Management**: \n  - Trusting a device issues a 30-day token; untrusted issues a 24-hour token.\n  - Manage devices via CLI; dashboard support for ZenML Pro is not yet available.\n\n#### Key Commands\n1. **Login**: `zenml login <URL>` to start device flow.\n2. **List Devices**: `zenml authorized-device list` to see permitted devices.\n3. **Describe Device**: `zenml authorized-device describe <DEVICE_ID>` for detailed info.\n4. **Invalidate Token**: `zenml authorized-device lock <DEVICE_ID>` to revoke access.\n\n### Important Notice\n- Use trusted devices for security.\n- For ZenML Pro API, use Personal Access Token or Service Account instead of CLI login.\n- Regularly manage device trust levels to protect data and infrastructure.",
