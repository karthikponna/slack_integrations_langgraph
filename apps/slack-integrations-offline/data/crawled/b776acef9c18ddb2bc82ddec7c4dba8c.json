Concepts\n\n\nUnderstanding and working with ZenML Stacks and Stack Components\nA ZenML stack is a collection of components that together form an MLOps infrastructure to run your ML pipelines. While your pipeline code defines what happens in your ML workflow, the stack determines where and how that code runs.\nStacks provide several key benefits:\n  1. **Environment Flexibility** : Run the same pipeline code locally during development and in the cloud for production\n  2. **Infrastructure Separation** : Change your infrastructure without modifying your pipeline code\n  3. **Specialized Resources** : Use specialized tools for different aspects of your ML workflow\n  4. **Team Collaboration** : Share infrastructure configurations across your team\n  5. **Reproducibility** : Ensure consistent pipeline execution across different environments\n\n\n### \nStack Structure\nEach ZenML stack must include these core components:\n  * **Orchestrator** : Controls how your pipeline steps are executed\n  * **Artifact Store** : Manages where your pipeline artifacts are stored\n\n\nStacks may also include these optional components:\n  * **Container Registry** : Stores Docker images for your pipeline steps\n  * **Deployer** : Deploys pipelines as long-running HTTP services\n  * **Step Operator** : Runs specific steps on specialized hardware\n  * **Model Deployer** : Deploys models as prediction services\n  * **Experiment Tracker** : Tracks metrics and parameters\n  * **Feature Store** : Manages ML features\n  * **Alerter** : Sends notifications about pipeline events\n  * **Annotator** : Manages data labeling workflows\n\n\n## \nWorking with Stacks\n### \nThe Active Stack\nIn ZenML, you always have an active stack that's used when you run a pipeline:\nCopy```\n# See your active stack\nzenml stack describe\n# Switch to a different stack\nzenml stack set STACK_NAME\n```\n\n### \nManaging Stacks\nYou can create and manage stacks through the CLI:\nCopy```\n# List all stacks\nzenml stack list\n# Register a new stack with minimal components\nzenml stack register my-stack -a local-store -o local-orchestrator\n# Register a stack with additional components\nzenml stack register production-stack \\\n    -artifact-store s3-store \\\n    --orchestrator kubeflow \\\n    --container-registry ecr-registry \\\n    --experiment-tracker mlflow-tracker\n```\n\nOr through the Python API:\nCopy```\nfrom zenml.client import Client\nclient = Client()\n# List all stacks\nstacks = client.list_stacks()\n# Set active stack\nclient.activate_stack(\"my-stack\")\n```\n\n### \nLocal vs. Cloud Stacks\nZenML provides two main types of stacks:\n  1. **Local Stack** : Uses your local machine for orchestration and storage. This is the default and requires no additional setup.\n  2. **Cloud Stack** : Uses cloud services for orchestration, storage, and other components. These stacks offer more scalability and features but require additional deployment and configuration.\n\n\nWhen you start with ZenML, you're automatically using a local stack. As your ML projects grow, you'll likely want to deploy cloud stacks to handle larger workloads and collaborate with your team.\n## \nNext Steps\nNow that you understand what stacks are, you might want to:\n  * Learn about deploying stacks on cloud platforms\n  * Understand Service Connectors for authenticating with cloud services\n  * Explore how to register existing cloud resources as ZenML stack components\n\n\nPreviousVisualizationsNextService Connectors\nLast updated 2 months ago\nWas this helpful?\n",
