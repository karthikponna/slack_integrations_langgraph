ZenML provides built-in capabilities to visualize artifacts, helping you gain insights into your data, model performance, and pipeline execution.\n## \nAccessing Visualizations\nZenML automatically generates visualizations for many common data types, making it easy to inspect your artifacts without additional code.\n### \nDashboard Visualizations\nThe ZenML dashboard displays visualizations for artifacts produced by your pipeline runs:\nTo view visualizations in the dashboard:\n  1. Navigate to the **Runs** tab\n  2. Select a specific pipeline run\n  3. Click on any step to view its outputs\n  4. Select an artifact to view its visualizations\n\n\nZenML Artifact Visualizations\n### \nNotebook Visualizations\nYou can also display artifact visualizations in Jupyter notebooks using the `visualize()` method:\nCopy```\nfrom zenml.client import Client\n# Get an artifact from a previous pipeline run\nrun = Client().get_pipeline_run(\"<PIPELINE_RUN_ID>\")\nartifact = run.steps[\"<STEP_NAME>\"].outputs[<OUTPUT_NAME>][0]\n# Display the visualization\nartifact.visualize()\n```\n\noutput.visualize() Output\n## \nSupported Visualization Types\nZenML supports visualizations for many common data types out of the box:\n  * A statistical representation of a Pandas Dataframe represented as a png image.\n  * Drift detection reports by Evidently, Great Expectations, and whylogs.\n  * A Hugging Face datasets viewer embedded as a HTML iframe.\n\n\noutput.visualize() output for the Hugging Face datasets viewer\n## \nCreating Custom Visualizations\nIt is simple to associate a custom visualization with an artifact in ZenML, if the visualization is one of the supported visualization types. Currently, the following visualization types are supported:\n  * **HTML:** Embedded HTML visualizations such as data validation reports,\n  * **Image:** Visualizations of image data such as Pillow images (e.g. `PIL.Image`) or certain numeric numpy arrays,\n  * **CSV:** Tables, such as the pandas DataFrame `.describe()` output,\n  * **Markdown:** Markdown strings or pages.\n  * **JSON:** JSON strings or objects.\n\n\nThere are three ways how you can add custom visualizations to the dashboard:\n  * If you are already handling HTML, Markdown, CSV or JSON data in one of your steps, you can have them visualized in just a few lines of code by casting them to a special class inside your step.\n  * If you want to automatically extract visualizations for all artifacts of a certain data type, you can define type-specific visualization logic by building a custom materializer.\n\n\n### \nCurated Visualizations Across Resources\nCurated visualizations let you surface a specific artifact visualization across multiple ZenML resources. Each curated visualization links to exactly one resource—for example, a model performance report that appears on the model detail page, or a deployment health dashboard that shows up in the deployment view.\nCurated visualizations currently support the following resources:\n  * **Projects** – high-level dashboards and KPIs that summarize the state of a project.\n  * **Deployments** – monitoring pages for deployed pipelines.\n  * **Models** – evaluation dashboards and health views for registered models.\n  * **Pipelines** – reusable visual documentation attached to pipeline definitions.\n  * **Pipeline Runs** – detailed diagnostics for specific executions.\n  * **Pipeline Snapshots** – configuration/version comparisons for snapshot history.\n\n\nYou can create a curated visualization programmatically by linking an artifact visualization to a single resource. Provide the resource identifier and resource type directly when creating the visualization. The example below shows how to create separate visualizations for different resource types:\nCopy```\nfrom uuid import UUID\nfrom zenml.client import Client\nfrom zenml.enums import (\n    CuratedVisualizationSize,\n    VisualizationResourceTypes,\n)\nclient = Client()\n# Define the identifiers for the pipeline and run you want to enrich\npipeline_id = UUID(\"<PIPELINE_ID>\")\npipeline_run_id = UUID(\"<PIPELINE_RUN_ID>\")\n# Retrieve the artifact version produced by the evaluation step\npipeline_run = client.get_pipeline_run(pipeline_run_id)\nartifact_version_id = pipeline_run.output.get(\"evaluation_report\")\nartifact_version = client.get_artifact_version(artifact_version_id)\nartifact_visualizations = artifact_version.visualizations or []\n# Fetch the resources we want to enrich\nmodel = client.list_models().items[0]\nmodel_id = model.id\ndeployment = client.list_deployments().items[0]\ndeployment_id = deployment.id\nproject_id = client.active_project.id\npipeline_model = client.get_pipeline(pipeline_id)\npipeline_id = pipeline_model.id\npipeline_snapshot = pipeline_run.snapshot()\nsnapshot_id = pipeline_snapshot.id\npipeline_run_id = pipeline_run.id\n# Create curated visualizations for each supported resource type\nclient.create_curated_visualization(\n    artifact_visualization_id=artifact_visualizations[0].id,\n    resource_id=model_id,\n    resource_type=VisualizationResourceTypes.MODEL,\n    project_id=project_id,\n    display_name=\"Latest Model Evaluation\",\n)\nclient.create_curated_visualization(\n    artifact_visualization_id=artifact_visualizations[1].id,\n    resource_id=deployment_id,\n    resource_type=VisualizationResourceTypes.DEPLOYMENT,\n    project_id=project_id,\n    display_name=\"Deployment Health Dashboard\",\n)\nclient.create_curated_visualization(\n    artifact_visualization_id=artifact_visualizations[2].id,\n    resource_id=project_id,\n    resource_type=VisualizationResourceTypes.PROJECT,\n    display_name=\"Project Overview\",\n)\nclient.create_curated_visualization(\n    artifact_visualization_id=artifact_visualizations[3].id,\n    resource_id=pipeline_id,\n    resource_type=VisualizationResourceTypes.PIPELINE,\n    project_id=project_id,\n    display_name=\"Pipeline Summary\",\n)\nclient.create_curated_visualization(\n    artifact_visualization_id=artifact_visualizations[4].id,\n    resource_id=pipeline_run_id,\n    resource_type=VisualizationResourceTypes.PIPELINE_RUN,\n    project_id=project_id,\n    display_name=\"Run Results\",\n)\nclient.create_curated_visualization(\n    artifact_visualization_id=artifact_visualizations[5].id,\n    resource_id=snapshot_id,\n    resource_type=VisualizationResourceTypes.PIPELINE_SNAPSHOT,\n    project_id=project_id,\n    display_name=\"Snapshot Metrics\",\n)\n```\n\nAfter creation, the returned response includes the visualization ID. You can retrieve a specific visualization later with `Client.get_curated_visualization`:\nCopy```\nretrieved = client.get_curated_visualization(pipeline_viz.id, hydrate=True)\nprint(retrieved.display_name)\nprint(retrieved.resource.type)\nprint(retrieved.resource.id)\n```\n\nCurated visualizations are tied to their parent resources and automatically surface in the ZenML dashboard wherever those resources appear, so keep track of the IDs returned by `create_curated_visualization` if you need to reference them later.\n#### \nUpdating curated visualizations\nOnce you've created a curated visualization, you can update its display name, order, or tile size using `Client.update_curated_visualization`:\nCopy```\nfrom uuid import UUID\nclient.update_curated_visualization(\n    visualization_id=UUID(\"<CURATED_VISUALIZATION_ID>\"),\n    display_name=\"Updated Dashboard Title\",\n    display_order=10,\n    layout_size=CuratedVisualizationSize.HALF_WIDTH,\n)\n```\n\nWhen a visualization is no longer relevant, you can remove it entirely:\nCopy```\nclient.delete_curated_visualization(visualization_id=UUID(\"<CURATED_VISUALIZATION_ID>\"))\n```\n\n#### \nControlling display order and size\nThe optional `display_order` field determines how visualizations are sorted when displayed. Visualizations with lower order values appear first, while those with `None` (the default) appear at the end in creation order.\nWhen setting display orders, consider leaving gaps between values (e.g., 10, 20, 30 instead of 1, 2, 3) to make it easier to insert new visualizations later without renumbering everything:\nCopy```\n# Leave gaps for future insertions\nvisualization_a = client.create_curated_visualization(\n    artifact_visualization_id=artifact_visualizations[0].id,\n    resource_type=VisualizationResourceTypes.PIPELINE,\n    resource_id=pipeline_id,\n    display_name=\"Model performance at a glance\",\n    display_order=10,  # Primary dashboard\n    layout_size=CuratedVisualizationSize.HALF_WIDTH,\n)\nvisualization_b = client.create_curated_visualization(\n    artifact_visualization_id=artifact_visualizations[1].id,\n    resource_type=VisualizationResourceTypes.PIPELINE,\n    resource_id=pipeline_id,\n    display_name=\"Drill-down metrics\",\n    display_order=20,  # Secondary metrics\n    layout_size=CuratedVisualizationSize.HALF_WIDTH,  # Compact chart beside the primary tile\n)\n# Later, easily insert between them\nvisualization_c = client.create_curated_visualization(\n    artifact_visualization_id=artifact_visualizations[2].id,\n    resource_type=VisualizationResourceTypes.PIPELINE,\n    resource_id=pipeline_id,\n    display_name=\"Raw output preview\",\n    display_order=15,  # Now appears between A and B\n    layout_size=CuratedVisualizationSize.FULL_WIDTH,\n)\n```\n\n#### \nRBAC visibility\nCurated visualizations respect the access permissions of the resource they're linked to. A user can only see a curated visualization if they have read access to the specific resource it targets. If a user lacks permission for the linked resource, the visualization will be hidden from their view.\nFor example, if you create a visualization linked to a specific deployment, only users with read access to that deployment will see the visualization. If you need the same visualization to appear in different contexts with different access controls (e.g., on both a project page and a deployment page), create separate curated visualizations for each resource. This ensures that visualizations never inadvertently expose information from resources a user shouldn't access, while giving you fine-grained control over visibility.\n### \nVisualization via Special Return Types\nIf you already have HTML, Markdown, CSV or JSON data available as a string inside your step, you can simply cast them to one of the following types and return them from your step:\n  * `zenml.types.HTMLString` for strings in HTML format, e.g., `\"<h1>Header</h1>Some text\"`,\n  * `zenml.types.MarkdownString` for strings in Markdown format, e.g., `\"# Header\\nSome text\"`,\n  * `zenml.types.CSVString` for strings in CSV format, e.g., `\"a,b,c\\n1,2,3\"`.\n  * `zenml.types.JSONString` for strings in JSON format, e.g., `{\"key\": \"value\"}`.\n\n\n#### \nExample:\nCopy```\nfrom zenml import step\nfrom zenml.types import CSVString\n@step\ndef my_step() -> CSVString:\n    some_csv = \"a,b,c\\n1,2,3\"\n    return CSVString(some_csv)\n```\n\nThis would create the following visualization in the dashboard:\nCSV Visualization Example\n**Shared CSS for Consistent Visualizations**\nWhen creating multiple HTML visualizations across your pipeline, consider using a shared CSS file to maintain consistent styling. Create a central CSS file with your design system (colors, components, layouts) and Python utilities to load it into your HTML templates. This approach eliminates code duplication, ensures visual consistency across all reports, and makes it easy to update styling across all visualizations from a single location.\nYou can create helper functions that return complete HTML templates with shared styles, and use CSS variables for theme management. This pattern is especially valuable for teams generating multiple HTML reports or dashboards where maintaining a professional, cohesive appearance is important.\nAnother example is visualizing a matplotlib plot by embedding the image in an HTML string:\nCopy```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport base64\nimport io\nfrom zenml.types import HTMLString\nfrom zenml import step, pipeline\n@step\ndef create_matplotlib_visualization() -> HTMLString:\n    \"\"\"Creates a matplotlib visualization and returns it as embedded HTML.\"\"\"\n    # Create plot\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])\n    ax.set_title('Sample Plot')\n    \n    # Convert plot to base64 string\n    buf = io.BytesIO()\n    fig.savefig(buf, format='png', bbox_inches='tight', dpi=300)\n    plt.close(fig)  # Clean up\n    image_base64 = base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode('utf-8')\n    \n    # Create HTML with embedded image\n    html = f'''\n    <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n        <img src=\"data:image/png;base64,{image_base64}\" \n             style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n    </div>\n    '''\n    \n    return HTMLString(html)\n@pipeline\ndef visualization_pipeline():\n    create_matplotlib_visualization()\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    visualization_pipeline()\n```\n\n### \nVisualization via Materializers\nIf you want to automatically extract visualizations for all artifacts of a certain data type, you can do so by overriding the `save_visualizations()` method of the corresponding materializer. Let's look at an example of how to visualize matplotlib figures in your ZenML dashboard:\n#### \nExample: Matplotlib Figure Visualization\n**1. Custom Class** First, we create a custom class to hold our matplotlib figure:\nCopy```\nfrom typing import Any\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nclass MatplotlibVisualization(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Custom class to hold matplotlib figures.\"\"\"\n    figure: Any  # This will hold the matplotlib figure\n```\n\n**2. Materializer** Next, we create a custom materializer that handles this class and implements the visualization logic:\nCopy```\nimport os\nfrom typing import Dict\nfrom zenml.materializers.base_materializer import BaseMaterializer\nfrom zenml.enums import VisualizationType\nfrom zenml.io import fileio\nclass MatplotlibMaterializer(BaseMaterializer):\n    \"\"\"Materializer that handles matplotlib figures.\"\"\"\n    ASSOCIATED_TYPES = (MatplotlibVisualization,)\n    def save_visualizations(\n        self, data: MatplotlibVisualization\n    ) -> Dict[str, VisualizationType]:\n        \"\"\"Create and save visualizations for the matplotlib figure.\"\"\"\n        visualization_path = os.path.join(self.uri, \"visualization.png\")\n        with fileio.open(visualization_path, 'wb') as f:\n            data.figure.savefig(f, format='png', bbox_inches='tight')\n        return {visualization_path: VisualizationType.IMAGE}\n```\n\n**3. Step** Finally, we create a step that returns our custom type:\nCopy```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom zenml import step\n@step\ndef create_matplotlib_visualization() -> MatplotlibVisualization:\n    \"\"\"Creates a matplotlib visualization.\"\"\"\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])\n    ax.set_title('Sample Plot')\n    return MatplotlibVisualization(figure=fig)\n```\n\nWhen you use this step in your pipeline:\n  1. The step creates and returns a `MatplotlibVisualization`\n  2. ZenML finds the `MatplotlibMaterializer` and calls `save_visualizations()`\n  3. The figure is saved as a PNG file in your artifact store\n  4. The dashboard loads and displays this PNG when you view the artifact\n\n\nFor another example, see our Hugging Face datasets materializer which visualizes datasets by embedding their preview viewer.\n## \nControlling Visualizations\n### \nAccess to Visualizations\nIn order for the visualizations to show up on the dashboard, the following must be true:\n#### \nConfiguring a Service Connector\nVisualizations are usually stored alongside the artifact, in the artifact store. Therefore, if a user would like to see the visualization displayed on the ZenML dashboard, they must give access to the server to connect to the artifact store.\nThe service connector documentation goes deeper into the concept of service connectors and how they can be configured to give the server permission to access the artifact store. For a concrete example, see the AWS S3 artifact store documentation.\nWhen using the default/local artifact store with a deployed ZenML, the server naturally does not have access to your local files. In this case, the visualizations are also not displayed on the dashboard.\nPlease use a service connector enabled and remote artifact store alongside a deployed ZenML to view visualizations.\n#### \nConfiguring Artifact Stores\nIf all visualizations of a certain pipeline run are not showing up in the dashboard, it might be that your ZenML server does not have the required dependencies or permissions to access that artifact store. See the custom artifact store docs page for more information.\n### \nEnabling/Disabling Visualizations\nYou can control whether visualizations are generated at the pipeline or step level:\nCopy```\n# Disable visualizations for a pipeline\n@pipeline(enable_artifact_visualization=False)\ndef my_pipeline():\n    ...\n# Disable visualizations for a step\n@step(enable_artifact_visualization=False)\ndef my_step():\n    ...\n```\n\nYou can also configure this in YAML:\nCopy```\nenable_artifact_visualization: False\nsteps:\n  my_step:\n    enable_artifact_visualization: True\n```\n\n## \nConclusion\nVisualizing artifacts is a powerful way to gain insights from your ML pipelines. ZenML's built-in visualization capabilities make it easy to understand your data and model outputs, identify issues, and communicate results.\nBy leveraging these visualization tools, you can better understand your ML workflows, debug problems more effectively, and make more informed decisions about your models.\nPreviousMaterializersNextStack & Components\nLast updated 1 month ago\nWas this helpful?\n",
